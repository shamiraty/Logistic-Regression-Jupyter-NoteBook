# Logistic Regression: Predicting Diabetes Likelihood

## Problem Statement
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on factors such as Glucose Level, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, and Age. The dependent variable \( Y \) is binary (0 for no diabetes, 1 for diabetes), and logistic regression is used to model this relationship.

## Main Objective
To establish a mathematical relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (diabetes likelihood) using Python's machine learning libraries.

## Specific Objectives
1. **Problem Statement**: Clearly define the problem and its scope.
2. **Data Collection**: Gather relevant data for model training.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze data distributions and relationships.
4. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and remove anomalies.
5. **Model Selection & Training**: Choose logistic regression and train the model.
6. **Model Evaluation & Accuracy Testing**: Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
7. **Feature Selection**: Determine the importance of each independent variable.
8. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters for better performance.
9. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict diabetes likelihood.
10. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the model using Streamlit or Django for user interaction.

## Methodology
1. Logistic regression is employed due to the binary nature of the target variable.
2. Regression analysis identifies positive or negative correlations between independent variables (\( X \)) and the dependent variable (\( Y \)).
3. Coefficients of correlation are used to measure the influence of each feature on diabetes prediction.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python: For data processing and machine learning.
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- Deployment Platforms: Streamlit or Django.

## Outcome
The model will predict diabetes likelihood based on the given features and quantify the contribution of each feature to the prediction.

## Future Work
Extend the model to include more features and validate its performance on diverse datasets.
